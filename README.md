# Movie API Using Fetch

Welcome to this fun project 

This is a super minimalistic Project that uses the OMDAPI and allows the user to search for a movie by name. 

This was a fun side project for me to brush up on some basic Javascript fundamentals as well as get a bit more work in with API's and the DOM.
